🎮 How to Play
Open index.html in any modern web browser.

Player X starts first by clicking on any empty box.

Player O follows. The game alternates turns automatically.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

If all 9 boxes are filled and no one has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.
